Have you ever just wanted to play a game or watch a movie but your mom was on over your head and made you study ? Did you ever just wanted to do what you want ? Well you can now. Using your webcam you can select the window that you want to close when the webcam detects movement. Just point the webcam at your door or something and when it detects it will minimize the selected window and name it '#' without ' .
